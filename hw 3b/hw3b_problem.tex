Each of these tasks need to be executed in a specific time interval. Two tasks are set to be compatible if their time intervals do not overlap. The goal is to find the maximum set of compatible tasks so that as many tasks possible can be executed. For example consider the case of just three tasks\\

        \textbf{Note} \\
        A comment on level of justification  to help us understand your thinking, it is worth writing a little about the order in which the algorithm selects the tasks. For example, The algorithm consider tasks in the order [Task 3, Task 2, Task 1]: first the algorithm selects Task 3 because that is the shortest. Task 1 conflicts Task3, so it is removed. In the next step the shortest and only remaining Task 2 is selected.

	In this question we'll consider weighted problems.
	}
	\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item{\itshape
	Consider the weighted interval scheduling problem. In this problem, the input is
a list of n tasks and weights, each of which is specified by $(start_i; end_i;w_i)$.
The goal is now to find a subset of the given intervals in which no two overlap and
to maximize the sum of the weights, rather than the total number of intervals in
your subset. That is, if your list has length $n$, the goal is to find $S \subseteq \{1, 2, ... n\}$
such that for any $i, j \in  S$, interval i and interval j do not overlap, and maximizing
$\sum_{i \in S} w_it_i$. Consider the greedy algorithm for interval scheduling from recitation, which selects the job with the earliest end time first. Give an example of weighted interval
scheduling with at least 5 intervals where this greedy algorithm fails. Show the
order in which the algorithm selects the intervals, and also show a higher-weight
subset of non-overlapping intervals than the subset output by the greedy algorithm.

	Considering a greedy algorithm which always the longest task first, the algorithm fails to maximize the weight in scheduling. The algorithm considers all 5 times in this order [$w_a,w_b,w_c,w_d,w_e$]. 
	 The algorithm will select $w_a$ first.
	 The algorithm will the remove $w_b$.
	THe algorithm will then select $w_c$ as the next schedule with the earliest end time.
	The algorithm will then evaluate $w_d$ and remove it.
	$w_e$ is the last of the intervals to be evaluated and selected. The greedy algorithm gives us the interval schedule : [$w_a,w_c, w_e)$]= 3. This algorithm fails to give the optimal weight. The optimal weight would be 7 with a schedule interval of [$w_c,w_e$].

	\item{\itshape
	Consider the Knapsack problem: the input is a list of $n$ items, each with a
value and weight ($val_i;wt_i$), and a threshold weight $W$. All values and weights
are strictly positive. The goal is to select a subset $S$ of the items such that
$\sum_{i \in S} w_i t_i < W$ and maximizing $\sum_{i \in S} val_i$. (Note that, unlike change-making, here there is only one of each item, whereas in change-making you in principle
have an unlimited number of each type of coin.) Consider a greedy algorithm for
this problem which makes greedy choices as follows: among the remaining items,
choose the item of maximum value such that it will not make the total weight exceed the threshold $W$. Give an example of knapsack with at least 5 items where this
greedy algorithm fails. Show the order in which the algorithm selects the items,
and also show a higher-value subset whose weight does not exceed the threshold.

value of item $i$ the ratio $\frac{val_i}{wt_i}$. Consider the greedy algorithm which, among

not make the total weight exceed the threshold $W$. Give an example of knapsack
